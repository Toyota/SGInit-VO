**SGInit-VO** is a repository containing scripts to replicate the experiment in the paper, titled <i> "Self-Supervised Geometry-Guided Initialization for Robust Monocular Visual
Odometry." </i> by Takayuki Kanai, Igor Vasiljevic, Vitor Guizilini, and Kazuhiro Shintani.

**UPDATE**: Accepted at [IROS2025](https://www.iros25.org/)ðŸš€

The paper and the project page are available:

- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00929v1

## Installation

Add submodule libraries.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
make noroot-build
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation
Appropriately modify the `CKPT_MNT`, `DATA_MNT`, etc. at [Makefile](Makefile) and run:

```bash
xhost +local:root # if needed for GUI
make noroot-interactive
```
We enter the container, and the following procedures are conducted inside the container hereafter.

#### Download dataset, models, etc. (for your first time)
Please download the dependent items to your PC as follows: 

```bash
./tools/download_ddad.sh # for DDAD (40GB) datasets
python ./tools/download_models.py # for pretrained models
```

#### Replicate Visual Odometry (SG-Init + DROID (L), GIF's Right)

```bash
./shells/run.sh
```

#### Replicate Ablation Model (ZeroDepth + DROID)

```bash
./shells/run_ablation.sh
```


#### Replicate Depth Evaluation  (ResNet18 from ``L'' model)
```bash
python3 thirdparty/vidar/scripts/launch.py configs/papers/sginit/inference_resnet18s.yaml
```

#### Running on your own data
Please refer to [TUTORIAL.md](materials/TUTORIAL.md) for more details.
